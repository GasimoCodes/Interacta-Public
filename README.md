Interacta is a powerful and intuitive Unity3D interaction framework designed for seamless integration into any Player Controller setup. 
This allows players to **select objects just by loosely looking at them** (as opposed to having to align them dead-center in the camera view), making your games much more accessible and intuitive.

Playable Demo is available for download in the Releases Section.
